## ✅ What I Learned

### transition to border on hover

```
.nav a {

  transition: border-top 0.3s ease; /* Adjust the duration and timing function as needed */
}
```

- border-top: Specifies that the transition effect applies to the border-top property.
- 0.3s: Duration of the transition effect. You can adjust this value to make the transition faster or slower.
- ease: Timing function for the transition. This can be changed to other timing functions like linear, ease-in, ease-out
